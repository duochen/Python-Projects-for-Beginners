### Project 1: **Algorithm - The Sorting Race**

#### **Description:**
In this project, students will create a Python program that compares different sorting algorithms. They will implement and test popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. The program will generate random lists of numbers and sort them using each algorithm. Students will then measure and compare the time each algorithm takes to sort the lists and visualize the results.

#### **Learning Objectives:**
1. Implement and understand basic sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.
2. Learn how to measure the performance of algorithms using time complexity analysis.
3. Develop skills in generating random data and handling lists in Python.
4. Gain experience in visualizing algorithm performance and comparing efficiency.

#### **Extensions:**
1. Implement additional sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort or Heap Sort.
2. Create graphical visualizations of the sorting process to better understand how each algorithm works.
3. Analyze the time complexity of each sorting algorithm with different input sizes and types of data.
4. Explore optimizations for each sorting algorithm and compare their impact on performance.
