### Project 2: **Optimization - The Knapsack Problem**

#### **Description:**
In this project, students will solve the classic Knapsack Problem using the Greedy algorithm. They will create a Python program that selects items to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack. Each item has a weight and value, and the goal is to maximize the total value of the selected items.

### **Algorithm:**

#### **Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand the Knapsack Problem and its variations.
2. Learn how to implement the Greedy algorithm for optimization.
3. Develop skills in managing and manipulating lists and tuples in Python.
4. Analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the Greedy approach.

#### **Extensions:**
1. Implement and compare other approaches like Dynamic Programming for solving the Knapsack Problem.
2. Create a graphical representation of the selected items and their values.
3. Extend the problem to handle multiple knapsacks or items with different constraints.
4. Allow users to input their own item weights, values, and knapsack capacity.
