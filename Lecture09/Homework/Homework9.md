### Python Project: Optimizing a Maze Path

#### Project Description

In this project, students will design and optimize an algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze. The maze will be represented as a grid of cells where some cells are blocked and others are free. The goal is to implement a pathfinding algorithm that will determine the shortest path from the start point to the end point. The project will introduce students to basic algorithm design and optimization concepts, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and optimization techniques to improve algorithm efficiency.

#### Learning Objectives

1. **Understand Algorithm Design**: Students will learn how to design an algorithm to solve a real-world problem, such as finding the shortest path in a maze.
2. **Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Students will implement the BFS algorithm, which is a fundamental pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path in unweighted grids.
3. **Optimize Algorithms**: Students will explore optimization techniques to make their algorithms more efficient.
4. **Visualize Solutions**: Students will visualize the maze and the shortest path to better understand the algorithm's behavior and results.

#### Extensions

1. **Enhance the Maze**: Add more complex features to the maze, such as multiple start and end points, or different types of obstacles.
2. **Use A* Algorithm**: Implement the A* search algorithm, which is more efficient for larger mazes compared to BFS, by incorporating heuristics.
3. **Create a GUI**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the maze using a library like Tkinter or Pygame to make the project more interactive.
4. **Maze Generation**: Implement a maze generation algorithm, such as Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm, to create random mazes for testing the pathfinding algorithm.
