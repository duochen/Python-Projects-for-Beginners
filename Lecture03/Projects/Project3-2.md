### Project 2: Vigenère Cipher (Ciphers)

**Description:**
In this project, students will implement the Vigenère cipher, a method of encrypting text using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. The program will allow users to input a message and a keyword, then encrypt or decrypt the message using the Vigenère cipher.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the concept of encryption and decryption.
- Implement a classical cipher using string manipulation.
- Practice working with loops and modular arithmetic.


**Extensions:**
- Allow students to implement other classical ciphers like Caesar or Atbash.
- Challenge students to break the Vigenère cipher without knowing the keyword by analyzing letter frequencies.
- Let students add a graphical interface where users can drag and drop text files for encryption and decryption.
