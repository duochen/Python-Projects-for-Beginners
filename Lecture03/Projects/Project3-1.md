### Project 1: Anagram Generator (String Manipulation)

**Description:**
In this project, students will create a program that generates all possible anagrams of a given word or phrase. An anagram is a rearrangement of the letters in a word to form a new word or phrase. The program will allow users to input a word or phrase and then display all possible anagrams, filtering out any that arenâ€™t real words using a dictionary file.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand and implement string manipulation techniques.
- Practice recursion and combinatorial algorithms.
- Work with file I/O and filtering using dictionaries.

**Extensions:**
- Modify the program to handle multi-word anagrams (e.g., "listen" to "silent").
- Allow students to add a scoring system based on word length or frequency of letters.
- Let students add a graphical interface using `tkinter` to make the tool more interactive.
