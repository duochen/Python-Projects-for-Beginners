### Python Project: Cipher Text Adventure

**Project Description:**

In this project, you'll create a Python program that implements and uses various classical ciphers to encode and decode messages. You will design a simple text-based adventure game where players need to decode hidden messages to progress through the game. Each level of the game will involve a different cipher, and players must solve cipher challenges to unlock the next level.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. **Understand and Implement Classical Ciphers:** Learn how to implement classic ciphers such as Caesar Cipher, Atbash Cipher, and Vigenère Cipher.
2. **String Manipulation:** Practice string operations including slicing, joining, and character manipulation.
3. **Debugging and Problem Solving:** Enhance your problem-solving skills by debugging and optimizing your cipher implementation.
4. **User Interaction:** Gain experience in designing a user-friendly interface for interacting with your program.

**Extensions:**

1. **Create More Ciphers:** Add additional ciphers to the game, such as the Playfair Cipher or the RSA algorithm (for advanced students).
2. **Graphical Interface:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt to make the game more interactive.
3. **Multiplayer Feature:** Implement a feature that allows players to send encoded messages to each other and solve each other’s challenges.
4. **Difficulty Levels:** Add different difficulty levels by varying the complexity of the ciphers and the length of the encoded messages.
