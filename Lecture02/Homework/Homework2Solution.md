**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Directory Setup:** The `directory` variable specifies the directory to be organized. Change `'path/to/your/directory'` to the actual path.

2. **File Type Categories:** The `file_types` dictionary categorizes file types into different folders.

3. **Creating Folders:** The `create_folders` function ensures that the required folders exist in the specified directory.

4. **Organizing Files:** The `organize_files` function loops through files, determines their type, and moves them to the appropriate folder. If a file with the same name already exists, it renames the file by adding a timestamp to avoid conflicts.

5. **Execution:** The script creates folders and organizes files when run.
