### Project Description: Automated File Organizer

**Description:**

In this project, students will create a Python script that automatically organizes files in a specified directory. The script will sort files into folders based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, videos) and rename files with a timestamp to avoid naming conflicts. This project will help students learn about file handling, automation, and working with file paths.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. **File Handling:** Understand how to read and write files, manipulate file paths, and manage directories in Python.
2. **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks using Python scripts to improve productivity.
3. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to manage exceptions that may occur during file operations.
4. **String Manipulation:** Use string operations to rename files and create organized directories.
5. **Libraries:** Utilize Python standard libraries such as `os`, `shutil`, and `datetime`.

**Extensions:**

1. **File Type Icons:** Add functionality to move files into subfolders based on specific categories, like separating images into "Photos" and "Screenshots."
2. **User Interface:** Create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter` to allow users to select directories and initiate the file organization process.
3. **Log File:** Implement logging to create a report of all file movements and renamings performed by the script.
4. **Scheduled Task:** Extend the script to run at scheduled intervals using Pythonâ€™s `schedule` library or system cron jobs.
