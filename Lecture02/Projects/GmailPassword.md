Finding the SMTP password for your Gmail account is typically tied to your Google account security settings, as Google does not directly show you the password. However, you can use "App Passwords" to generate a unique password for SMTP if you have 2-Step Verification enabled. Here's how to do that:

### Steps to Generate an SMTP Password (App Password) for Gmail:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** (if it's not already enabled):
   - Go to your [Google Account Security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   - Scroll down to "Signing in to Google" and look for "2-Step Verification".
   - Follow the steps to enable it by adding your phone number for authentication.

2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, return to the [Security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   - Under "Signing in to Google," click on **App passwords**.
   - Sign in again for verification.
   - In the "Select app" dropdown, choose **Mail**.
   - In the "Select device" dropdown, choose **Other** and type a descriptive name like "SMTP".
   - Click **Generate**.
   - Google will provide you with a 16-character password. **Copy this password** â€” this is your SMTP password.

3. **Use the App Password**:
   - Use the generated password in your email client or script (like your SMTP configuration) in place of your regular Google password.

### Notes:
- This password is specific to the app and can be revoked at any time.
- If you don't have 2-Step Verification enabled, you'll need to do so to generate an app password, as Google no longer allows using regular account passwords for less secure apps or SMTP.
