### Project 1: Personal Diary Application (File Handling)

**Description:**
In this project, students will create a personal diary application where they can write daily entries and save them to files. The program will allow users to create, read, and search diary entries. Each entry will be saved as a text file, named with the date of the entry. The application will also have a feature that lets users search for specific words or phrases across all entries.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand and implement file handling in Python.
- Practice reading from and writing to text files.
- Learn about string manipulation, file paths, and basic text search algorithms.

**Extensions:**
- Add password protection to the diary by encrypting the files.
- Implement a feature that summarizes the entries for the past week or month.
- Allow users to tag entries and search based on tags.
