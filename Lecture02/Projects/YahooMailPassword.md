Unfortunately, it's not possible to directly find your Yahoo Mail SMTP password because Yahoo uses the same password for both your email login and SMTP server access. However, if you're trying to set up your Yahoo Mail in an email client (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird) or another application that requires SMTP access, you'll need to create an **App Password** for secure access.

### Here's how to generate an App Password for Yahoo Mail:

1. **Log in to your Yahoo Mail account** on a web browser.
2. **Go to your account settings**:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
   - Select **Account Info** or **Account Security**.
3. **Enable Two-Step Verification** (if not enabled already):
   - You may need to set up two-factor authentication before generating an app password.
4. **Generate an App Password**:
   - In the **Account Security** section, look for **Manage App Passwords**.
   - Choose the app or device you want to generate a password for (e.g., **Outlook**, **Mail**).
   - Click **Generate**.
5. **Copy the App Password** provided by Yahoo.
6. **Use this password** when setting up your Yahoo Mail in the email client or application that asks for the SMTP password.

### SMTP Server Settings for Yahoo Mail:
- **SMTP server**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com`
- **Port**: 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS)
- **Authentication**: Required (Use your full Yahoo email address)
- **Password**: Use the app password you generated, not your regular email password.

This app password ensures that your regular Yahoo password is kept secure when using third-party email clients.
