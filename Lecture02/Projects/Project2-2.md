### Project 2: Automated Email Sender (Automation)

**Description:**
In this project, students will create a Python script that automatically sends emails based on certain criteria. The program can be used to send reminder emails, weekly updates, or even birthday wishes. Students will learn how to automate tasks using Python and interact with external services like email servers.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand and implement automation using Python.
- Learn how to interact with email servers using the `smtplib` library.
- Practice working with file handling for reading email lists and message templates.

**Extensions:**
- Schedule the script to run automatically at specific times using a task scheduler like `cron` on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows.
- Allow students to add attachments to the emails.
- Implement a feature that personalizes emails further by including information like the recipientâ€™s name.
