#### **Explanation:**
1. **Maze Representation**: The maze is represented as a 2D list where 0 represents open paths, 1 represents walls, 'S' is the start, and 'E' is the exit.
2. **Recursive Backtracking**: The function `solve_maze` uses recursion to try all possible paths. If a valid path is found, the recursion stops. If no valid path exists from a point, it backtracks to try a different route.
3. **Path**: The path is stored as a list of (x, y) coordinates.

#### **Why It's Fun and Engaging:**
- **Interactive**: Students can design their own mazes and test the solver.
- **Problem-solving challenge**: It teaches logical thinking through a fun challenge.
- **Customizable**: Students can extend the project with their own ideas, like visualizing the maze-solving process, adding animations, or creating more complex mazes.
