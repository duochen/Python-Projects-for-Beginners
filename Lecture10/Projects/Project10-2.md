### Project 2: **Maze Solver Using Recursion**

#### **Project Description:**
In this project, students will create a Python program that solves a maze using recursion. The maze will be represented as a grid, where each cell is either passable (a path) or blocked (a wall). The goal is to find a path from a starting point (entrance) to an ending point (exit) using recursive backtracking. The program will output the solution path if one exists or indicate that no path is found.

#### **Learning Objectives:**
By completing this project, students will learn:
1. **Recursion**: Understand and apply the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
2. **Backtracking**: Explore how to implement backtracking to try different paths and retreat when a dead-end is reached.
3. **Grid-based problem-solving**: Learn how to represent and navigate grid-based puzzles like mazes.
4. **Basic Python concepts**: Reinforce understanding of lists, loops, conditionals, and function calls.

#### **Project Extensions (Optional Enhancements):**
1. **Maze Generation**: Add a feature to randomly generate mazes of different sizes and complexity.
2. **User Interaction**: Let the user input their own maze designs or modify the starting and ending points.
3. **Graphical Interface**: Use libraries like `pygame` or `turtle` to visually display the maze and the solving process.
4. **Alternative Algorithms**: Implement alternative maze-solving algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
5. **Maze Animation**: Animate the recursive search through the maze to show how the backtracking works in real-time.
