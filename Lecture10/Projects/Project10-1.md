#### **Project Description:**

In this project, students will create an interactive virtual pet application. The pet will have attributes such as hunger, happiness, and energy, which change over time based on user interactions. The goal is to build a console-based application where users can feed, play with, and put their pet to sleep. The application will provide real-time feedback and updates on the pet's status.

Students will learn to manage state in a program, handle user input, and use object-oriented programming principles to model the pet's behavior. This project will also introduce basic concepts of game development and simulation.

#### **Learning Objectives:**

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Students will learn to create and use classes and objects. They will model a virtual pet with attributes and methods that represent its behavior.
2. **State Management:** Students will manage and update the state of the virtual pet, including hunger, happiness, and energy levels.
3. **User Interaction:** Students will handle user input and provide real-time feedback based on user actions.
4. **Basic Game Logic:** Students will implement simple game mechanics and simulations.

#### **Extensions:**

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Enhance the project by creating a graphical user interface using a library like `tkinter` or `pygame`. This would provide a more engaging visual experience.
2. **Multiple Pets:** Extend the application to allow users to manage multiple pets, each with its own set of attributes.
3. **Pet Evolution:** Introduce a feature where pets can evolve or change appearance based on their care level over time.
4. **Data Persistence:** Implement a feature to save and load pet data to/from a file, allowing users to continue their game at a later time.

#### **Explanation:**

1. **Class Definition:** `VirtualPet` class models the pet with attributes (`hunger`, `happiness`, and `energy`) and methods to interact with the pet.
2. **Methods:** Methods like `feed()`, `play()`, and `sleep()` adjust the pet's attributes and provide feedback.
3. **Main Function:** Handles user input and invokes the appropriate pet methods. It also continuously loops to allow ongoing interaction.
