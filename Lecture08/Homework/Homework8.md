### Python Project: Web Scraper for Book Reviews

#### **Project Description**
In this project, students will create a Python program that scrapes book reviews from a popular online bookstore website and processes the data to generate a summary report. The project combines web scraping with file processing to extract and manage book review data.

**Project Outline:**
1. **Web Scraping**: Students will use Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape book reviews from a website.
2. **Data Processing**: They will save the scraped data into a CSV file.
3. **Data Analysis**: Students will analyze the data to find the average rating for each book and count the number of reviews.

#### **Learning Objectives**
1. **Web Scraping**: Understand how to use web scraping libraries in Python to extract data from web pages.
2. **File Handling**: Learn to write data to CSV files and read data from them.
3. **Data Analysis**: Gain experience in analyzing and processing data to extract meaningful insights.
4. **Python Libraries**: Become familiar with `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` libraries.

#### **Extensions**
1. **User Input**: Allow the user to input the URL of the bookstore and the number of pages to scrape.
2. **Data Visualization**: Generate visualizations (like bar charts) to display the average rating of books.
3. **Enhanced Data Processing**: Include additional features like filtering reviews based on rating or date.
