### Python Project 1: File Processing - "Text Adventure Story Generator"

#### **Project Description:**
In this project, students will create a "Text Adventure Story Generator" that processes text files containing different story elements (characters, settings, conflicts, resolutions) and assembles a complete, randomized adventure story. The generator will read from multiple text files, each containing different segments of a story (e.g., "character.txt", "setting.txt", etc.), and combine these elements in creative ways to create a new story each time it's run.

The project will focus on file processing (reading and writing text files), string manipulation, and basic control flow structures.

#### **Learning Objectives:**
- Understanding how to read from and write to text files in Python.
- Using lists and random selections to dynamically generate new content.
- Strengthening control flow concepts (loops, conditionals).
- Learning to manipulate strings and format text.
- Structuring code into functions to improve readability and maintainability.

#### **Extensions:**
- Allow the user to input custom elements into the text files (characters, settings, conflicts).
- Add a GUI interface using `tkinter` to make the program more interactive.
- Implement a save feature where the generated stories can be stored in a new text file.

This project requires students to create four text files (`characters.txt`, `settings.txt`, `conflicts.txt`, `resolutions.txt`) with different story components.
