### Python Project: Text Adventure Game - Data Parsing & Regular Expressions

**Project Description:**

In this project, you will create a simple text-based adventure game where the player navigates through different rooms and encounters various items and challenges. The game will use data parsing and regular expressions to handle user input and game state. You will design a game world with rooms and items, parse user commands to move between rooms, and use regular expressions to identify specific actions like picking up items or fighting enemies.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. **Understand Data Parsing:** Learn how to parse and process text data from user input and game data files.
2. **Use Regular Expressions:** Apply regular expressions to identify and extract specific patterns from strings.
3. **Handle Game State:** Manage and update the state of the game based on user actions and commands.
4. **Implement Basic Game Logic:** Develop simple game mechanics such as moving between rooms, picking up items, and fighting enemies.

**Extensions:**

1. **Add More Rooms and Items:** Expand the game world with additional rooms, items, and challenges.
2. **Implement Inventory System:** Create an inventory system where players can collect and use items.
3. **Add Enemy Encounters:** Introduce enemy characters that players can fight or avoid.
4. **Save and Load Game State:** Implement functionality to save and load the game state to continue playing later.
