### Project 1: **Weather Data Parser**

#### Project Description:
In this project, students will create a Python application that parses weather data from a CSV file and provides useful insights such as the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the number of rainy days. Students will also build a feature to plot temperature changes over time using `matplotlib`. The weather data will be stored in a CSV file with fields like Date, Temperature (in °C), Weather (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, etc.), and Precipitation (mm).

#### Learning Objectives:
- Understand how to read data from CSV files using Python's `csv` module.
- Learn how to clean and process raw data.
- Use Python’s list and dictionary comprehension for data manipulation.
- Explore data visualization using `matplotlib`.
- Implement error handling for missing or incorrect data in CSV files.
- Practice code modularization by separating parsing, calculations, and plotting into different functions.

#### Extensions:
- **Data Normalization:** Add a feature to normalize temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit or Kelvin.
- **Weather Trends:** Add a feature to calculate trends (e.g., detecting the hottest week or month).
- **Command-line Interface (CLI):** Create a simple command-line interface where the user can input a date range and the program outputs the average weather data for that range.
- **API Integration:** Instead of using a static CSV file, fetch real-time weather data from a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) and allow users to request weather insights for different cities.
