### Project 2: **Regular Expression Password Validator**

#### Project Description:
In this project, students will build a password validator using regular expressions (`re` module). The validator will check whether a password meets certain security criteria, such as containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. It will also check if the password is between 8 and 20 characters long.

The program will provide feedback on why a password is weak or strong. This project will challenge students to work with complex regular expressions and string manipulations.

#### Learning Objectives:
- Gain a deep understanding of Pythonâ€™s `re` module and how to write regular expressions.
- Learn how to validate user input against multiple conditions.
- Understand string operations and pattern matching.
- Practice writing functions that provide specific feedback based on input.
- Explore the importance of security through password validation.

#### Extensions:
- **Password Strength Meter:** Implement a scoring system that rates the password's strength (e.g., weak, medium, strong) based on how many criteria it meets.
- **Common Password Check:** Use a list of common passwords (like from a text file) and check if the input matches any of them.
- **Password Suggestions:** If the password is weak, suggest possible ways to strengthen it (e.g., adding numbers or special characters).
- **GUI Interface:** Build a simple graphical interface for the password validator using `tkinter`.
