## **Project 1: Text Transformation — Secret Message Encoder and Decoder**

### **Project Description:**
In this project, students will create a Python program that can encode and decode secret messages using different cipher techniques such as Caesar cipher and Morse code. The program will allow the user to input a message, choose an encoding technique, and transform the message. The same program will also allow the decoding of a secret message back into readable text.

### **Learning Objectives:**
- Understand how text can be transformed using different cipher techniques.
- Learn about Caesar cipher and Morse code algorithms.
- Practice string manipulation in Python.
- Develop user interaction skills using input/output operations.
- Enhance problem-solving skills by encoding and decoding text in various ways.

### **Extensions:**
- Add more encoding techniques like Base64, Atbash cipher, or Vigenère cipher.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for a more interactive experience.
- Implement a feature that analyzes the encoded message and suggests which cipher was used for encoding.
- Add error-checking to handle invalid inputs.
