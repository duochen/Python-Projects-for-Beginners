## **Project 2: Data Analysis â€” Movie Ratings Analyzer**

### **Project Description:**
In this project, students will analyze a dataset of movie ratings and find interesting insights using Python. The dataset contains information about movies, their genres, and user ratings. The students will write a Python program that calculates average ratings for different genres, finds the highest and lowest-rated movies, and visualizes the data using matplotlib.

### **Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how to read, analyze, and manipulate real-world datasets using pandas.
- Practice statistical analysis by calculating averages, minimums, and maximums.
- Visualize data using Python's matplotlib library.
- Enhance understanding of how data can be interpreted and communicated visually.
- Develop skills in data-driven problem solving.
- 
### **Sample Data:**
|title      | genre      | rating|
|-----------|------------|---------|    
|Movie1      |Action      |7.8|
|Movie2      |Comedy      |6.5|
|Movie3      |Drama       |9.0|
|Movie4      |Comedy      |5.2|
|Movie5      |Action      |8.3|

### **Extensions:**
- Implement filters to analyze ratings by year, director, or cast members.
- Add advanced data visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, or histograms.
- Analyze and visualize the correlation between user ratings and movie budgets or box office earnings.
- Integrate a recommendation system that suggests top-rated movies based on a genre preference.
