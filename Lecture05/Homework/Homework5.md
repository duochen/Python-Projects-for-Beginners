### Project Title: **Text Adventure Game and Data Analysis**

---

### Project Description:

In this project, you'll create a simple text-based adventure game where the player navigates through different rooms in a virtual world. The game will also keep track of various data points like the number of moves, items collected, and enemies encountered. After playing the game, you'll analyze the collected data to gain insights into player behavior and game performance.

#### **Part 1: Text Adventure Game**

1. **Game Setup**: Create a simple text-based adventure game. The player starts in a starting room and can move to different rooms based on their choices. Each room will have a description and options to move to adjacent rooms or interact with objects.

2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - The player can move between rooms using commands like "go north," "go south," etc.
   - The player can pick up items and add them to their inventory.
   - The player can encounter enemies and choose to fight or flee.
   - The game tracks the number of moves, items collected, and enemies defeated.

3. **Data Collection**: Store data about the game session, including:
   - The number of moves made.
   - The items collected.
   - The enemies encountered and defeated.

#### **Part 2: Data Analysis**

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - After the game ends, analyze the collected data to find out:
     - The average number of moves made per game.
     - The most frequently collected items.
     - The most common enemies encountered.
   - Visualize the data using charts or graphs (e.g., bar charts for item collection and enemy encounters).

2. **Text Transformation**:
   - Generate a summary report of the game session in text format, including the total number of moves, items collected, and enemies defeated.
   - Transform the game data into a JSON format for easier analysis.

### Learning Objectives:

1. **Programming Skills**: Practice writing Python code to create a text-based game with interactive elements.
2. **Data Handling**: Learn how to collect and store game data during runtime.
3. **Data Analysis**: Use Python libraries to analyze and visualize collected data.
4. **Text Transformation**: Transform and format game data into different formats like text and JSON.

### Extensions:

1. **Game Expansion**: Add more rooms, items, and enemies to make the game more complex and engaging.
2. **Advanced Data Analysis**: Implement more sophisticated analysis like tracking player performance over multiple games or predicting future behaviors.
3. **User Interface**: Create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for the game using a library like `tkinter` or `pygame`.
