#### **Project Description:**
Create an interactive quiz game that tests the user's knowledge on a variety of topics. The game should present multiple-choice questions and keep track of the user's score. The game will include features such as random question selection, user feedback, and a final score display. This project will help you revisit Python basics and introduce concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.

#### **Learning Objectives:**
1. **Reinforce Python Basics:** Review essential Python concepts such as variables, data types, lists, and dictionaries.
2. **Understand Control Flow:** Practice using loops and conditionals to control the flow of the program.
3. **Function Usage:** Learn to create and use functions to organize code and manage repetitive tasks.
4. **Input and Output Handling:** Handle user input and output effectively to create an interactive experience.
5. **Data Storage:** Use lists and dictionaries to store and manage data efficiently.

#### **Extensions:**
1. **Add Difficulty Levels:** Implement different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with corresponding question sets.
2. **Score Tracking:** Keep track of high scores and display a leaderboard.
3. **Timed Quiz:** Add a timer to challenge users to answer questions within a time limit.
4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Use a library like Tkinter to create a GUI for the quiz game.
