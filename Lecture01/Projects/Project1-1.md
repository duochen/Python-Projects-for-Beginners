### Project 1: **Number Guessing Game**

**Description:**
In this project, students will create a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player has to guess the number. The computer provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or decides to quit.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand and implement loops and conditional statements.
- Learn how to generate random numbers using the `random` module.
- Practice basic input and output operations.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through interactive gameplay.

**Extensions:**
- Allow the player to set the difficulty level, which changes the range of numbers.
- Track the playerâ€™s best score (fewest attempts) and display it at the end.
- Add a countdown timer to increase the difficulty.
