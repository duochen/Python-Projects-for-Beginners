### Project 2: **Basic Calculator**

**Description:**
In this project, students will create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will repeatedly ask the user for two numbers and an operator, then display the result. The program will continue running until the user chooses to exit.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Practice using functions to organize code.
- Reinforce understanding of arithmetic operators.
- Learn to handle user input and validate it.
- Develop a basic understanding of error handling (e.g., division by zero).

**Extensions:**
- Add support for additional operations such as exponentiation or modulus.
- Implement input validation to ensure the user enters valid numbers and operators.
- Create a history feature that stores and displays the results of previous calculations.
