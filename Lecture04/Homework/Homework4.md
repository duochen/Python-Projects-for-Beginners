### Python Project: Dice Rolling Simulation

#### Project Description
In this project, you will create a dice rolling simulation program that lets you explore the randomness of rolling a six-sided die. You will simulate rolling a die multiple times and then analyze the results to see how often each face of the die comes up. The project will help you understand randomness and basic statistical concepts. Additionally, you will visualize the results using a simple bar chart.

#### Learning Objectives
1. **Understand Randomness**: Gain an understanding of how randomness works by simulating the rolling of a die.
2. **Basic Statistics**: Learn how to calculate and interpret the frequency of each outcome from a random event.
3. **Data Visualization**: Develop skills in visualizing data using a bar chart to better understand the results of your simulation.
4. **Python Programming**: Practice using Python libraries and functions, such as `random`, `matplotlib`, and basic control structures like loops.

#### Extensions
1. **Multi-Sided Dice**: Extend the project to simulate dice with more sides (e.g., 10-sided or 20-sided dice) and compare the results.
2. **Interactive Interface**: Create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter` where users can specify the number of rolls and the number of sides on the die.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate additional statistical metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of the outcomes.
4. **Advanced Visualization**: Use different types of charts (e.g., pie charts or histograms) to represent the results.
