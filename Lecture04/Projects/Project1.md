### Project 1: Random Art Generator (Randomness)

**Description:**
In this project, students will create a program that generates random abstract art. The program will randomly place shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines on a canvas, choosing random colors, sizes, and positions. The goal is to explore how randomness can be used to create visually appealing and unique designs each time the program runs.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand and implement randomness using Pythonâ€™s `random` module.
- Practice using loops and conditionals.
- Explore basic graphics using the `turtle` or `pygame` library.

**Extensions:**
- Allow students to add more shapes like triangles or polygons.
- Let students modify the code to generate art based on specific themes (e.g., color palettes, symmetry).
- Use the `pygame` library for more advanced graphics and effects.
