### Project 2: Epidemic Spread Simulation (Simulation)

**Description:**
In this project, students will simulate the spread of a virus in a population. The program will model how the virus spreads from person to person based on certain probabilities. Students can visualize the epidemic's progress over time and analyze factors like infection rates and recovery rates.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand and implement basic simulations.
- Practice working with lists and loops.
- Explore concepts of probability and randomness in simulations.


**Extensions:**
- Allow students to modify parameters like infection probability or recovery time and observe the changes.
- Implement a more complex model, such as adding different groups with varying susceptibility or mobility.
- Introduce concepts of herd immunity or vaccination to explore their effects on the epidemic.
