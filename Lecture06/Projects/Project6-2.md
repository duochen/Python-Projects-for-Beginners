### Python Project 2: Debugging a Maze Solver

**Project Description:**  
In this project, students will work on a maze-solving algorithm using depth-first search (DFS) to find the path from a start point to an end point in a maze represented as a 2D list. The project will be intentionally filled with bugs (logical and syntactical) for students to identify, debug, and correct. This teaches debugging as a crucial skill in programming while solving a maze is a fun and engaging challenge.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Learn how to debug Python programs by identifying common issues (e.g., incorrect indexing, off-by-one errors).
2. Understand depth-first search (DFS) and its application in maze-solving algorithms.
3. Practice reading error messages and using Python’s debugging tools (e.g., `pdb`).
4. Develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills through troubleshooting code.

**Extensions:**
1. Allow the maze to have multiple start and end points, and modify the solver to find all possible paths.
2. Implement other pathfinding algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) or A* and compare their performance.
3. Create a visualization of the maze and the solving process using `matplotlib` or `pygame`.
4. Add additional challenges like dynamic obstacles or more complex mazes with multiple solutions.

### Debugging Instructions:
- Students should identify and fix errors like wrong recursion logic, incorrect handling of visited nodes, and off-by-one index errors.
- Use Python’s `pdb` debugger to step through the function and examine variable values.
