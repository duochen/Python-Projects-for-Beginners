### Bugs in the Initial Code:
1. **Incorrect boundary check:**  
   The condition `nx >= len(maze)` and `ny >= len(maze[0])` doesn't handle out-of-bound indices properly.
   
2. **Recursive call missing the return value:**  
   The recursive call `solve_maze(maze, (nx, ny), end, path + [(x, y)])` doesn't capture the return value. As a result, even if the path is found, it's not returned.

3. **Backtracking issue (not resetting visited nodes):**  
   After marking a node as visited (`maze[x][y] = 2`), the node remains marked in the future recursive calls. This prevents backtracking and blocks valid paths.

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Correct boundary check:**  
   Replaced `nx >= len(maze)` and `ny >= len(maze[0])` with `0 <= nx < len(maze)` and `0 <= ny < len(maze[0])`. This ensures the check properly handles out-of-bound indices.

2. **Return value capture in recursion:**  
   Fixed the recursive call by assigning the return value to `new_path` and checking if it's not `None`. If a valid path is found, it immediately returns the result.

3. **Backtracking implemented:**  
   After exploring all neighbors, the current cell is unmarked (`maze[x][y] = 0`), allowing future recursive calls to revisit the cell if needed. This is essential for backtracking in DFS.

Now, the code is working as expected, and the solver correctly finds the path if it exists.
