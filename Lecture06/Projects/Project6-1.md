### Project 1: Automated Test Case Generator
**Project Description:**  
In this project, students will develop an automated test case generator for math problems. The generator will create test cases for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and students will implement Python functions that perform the math operations and validate the results against the generated test cases. The project introduces students to the concept of automated testing and using assertions to ensure the accuracy of their code.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand the importance of testing in software development.
2. Learn how to generate random test cases using Python libraries like `random`.
3. Implement mathematical functions in Python and validate their correctness using assertions.
4. Gain experience in writing reusable functions to perform unit tests.
5. Understand how to handle edge cases and ensure the robustness of their code.

**Extensions:**
1. Extend the test case generator to handle more complex math problems, such as exponentiation, modulo, and roots.
2. Introduce the concept of boundary testing, where students must handle large numbers, negative numbers, and special cases like division by zero.
3. Create a user interface where the user can input their own math problems, and the program generates test cases to verify the solution.
4. Integrate the project with a basic machine learning model that predicts possible mistakes in solving math problems and adds relevant test cases.
