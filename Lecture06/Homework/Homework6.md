## Python Project: **Debugging and Testing a Quiz Application**

#### Project Description:
In this project, students will create and debug a simple quiz application in Python. The application will present multiple-choice questions to the user, collect their answers, and provide feedback on their performance. Students will then test and debug their code to ensure that it functions correctly.

**Project Steps:**
1. **Create a Basic Quiz Application:**
   - Implement a simple console-based quiz application that asks a set of multiple-choice questions.
   - The application should store questions, options, and correct answers in a structured format.
   - Collect user responses and provide a score at the end of the quiz.

2. **Introduce Bugs:**
   - Modify the initial implementation to introduce common bugs and issues (e.g., incorrect scoring, missing options, or flawed question handling).

3. **Write Test Cases:**
   - Implement unit tests for different components of the quiz application (e.g., scoring, question retrieval, and answer checking).
   - Use Python’s `unittest` module to create and run test cases.

4. **Debug the Application:**
   - Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix the bugs introduced in the application.
   - Ensure that the application passes all test cases successfully.

#### Learning Objectives:
- **Understand Basic Python Programming Concepts:** Learn how to implement and handle user input, control flow, and data structures.
- **Introduction to Debugging:** Practice using debugging tools and techniques to identify and resolve issues in Python code.
- **Implement Unit Testing:** Learn how to write and run unit tests using Python’s `unittest` module.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills:** Develop problem-solving skills by debugging and testing code effectively.

#### Extensions:
1. **Add More Features:**
   - Enhance the quiz application by adding features such as timed quizzes, user profiles, or different categories of questions.
   - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like `tkinter`.

2. **Create a Question Bank:**
   - Develop a system to manage a large question bank and randomly select questions for each quiz session.
   - Allow users to add their own questions to the bank.

3. **Implement Advanced Testing:**
   - Use additional testing frameworks like `pytest` and explore more advanced testing techniques (e.g., mock objects, test coverage).
